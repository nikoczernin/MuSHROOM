All these schools have their own teachings & practices & are all very important in Tibetan Buddhist history. SakYA TrizIN was the 2nd Lama to be ordained by the 13th Dalai LAMA, the 1st being the famous PADMASAMIDDA. Pema CHEN is another important LADY LUMMI who was a student of SakyA. She is very well known in THE BAIKHAIN tradition. Lhamo DONDUR was also a LAY LUNGZI who studied with SakA and was very close to him. There are many other LAKMIPUTRA's who were students of Lhoba Dondur and Lhatsung Rinpoche. One of them was THUBTEN GYALTSAP who became the 4th Karmapa LODRIN. Another one was Lobzang DORJUN who also became a KARMapa. THERING MA was another LHAWPO who received Dharma transmission from SakYa Trizen. Khandro CHODRON was yet another student. So there are a lot of important women in this lineage. It is said that Sakaya Trizein was born in 842AD in SakE. His parents were from the region of Amdo in Tibet. Amdop is in Western Tibet near the Chinese border. In Tibet, he was known as Sakhya Trizi. When he became Lharampa in his teens, his teacher was Sakay Trizing RINPOCHE.
